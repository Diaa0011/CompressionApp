# Data Compression Project

Alhamdulillah, excited to share a project in data compression! This project involves developing a Python program that takes any text input and provides
detailed insights into various compression metrics.

# Team Members
- AbdElRahman Mohamed Saad-ElDin
- Ammar Yasser Saad
- Karim Mohamed
- Omar Haridy
- Abdulrhman Kamel

# Algorithms Used
We worked on implementing and comparing the following five algorithms:
- Run-Length Encoding 
- Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Encoding
- Huffman Encoding
- Golomb Encoding
- Arithmetic Encoding

# Project Overview
Our Python program provides detailed insights into various compression metrics, including:

- üìä Bits Before Encoding
- üìâ Entropy
- üî¢ Bits After Encoding
- üìè Average Length
- üìâ Compression Ratio (CR)
- ‚ö° Efficiency
- üèÜ Best Algorithm based on performance metrics

One of the highlights of this project is the visualization of the Huffman
encoding tree, making the compression process intuitive and easy to grasp.
This project focuses exclusively on the encoding side of data compression, not decoding.

# Key Features
- **Input Text:** Accepts any text input.
- **Metrics Calculation:** Computes crucial metrics such as Bits Before Encoding, Entropy, Bits After Encoding, Average Length, Compression Ratio, and Efficiency.
- **Algorithm Evaluation:** Determines the most efficient compression algorithm based on the calculated metrics.
- **Huffman Tree Visualization:** Generates a visual representation of the Huffman encoding tree.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and accessible interface.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
` git clone https://github.com/Diaa0011/CompressionApp `
 ` cd CompressionApp `
2. Install the required Python packages:
* ` pip install tkinter `
* ` pip install matplotlib `
* ` pip install pillow `
* ` pip install numpy `
* ` pip install heapq `
* ` pip install graphviz `
 make sure to install graphviz from official website then add environment to all users path -not only installing python package-
*  https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/4207231/packages/generic/graphviz-releases/11.0.0/windows_10_cmake_Release_graphviz-install-11.0.0-win64.exe (direct link)

# Usage
1. Run the Python program:
`python inputOutput.py`
2. Enter the text you want to compress and analyze.
3. View the calculated metrics and the Huffman encoding tree visualization.
